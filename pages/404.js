          You told your friends you werenâ€™t bringing your phone, to try and
          experience what travel was like back in the day. You bought a map and
          a bottle of water and carried your camera for the money shot. But the
          map was from 2005 and the landscape had changed. So here you are, in
          the middle of a large field, that the map continues to claim is a
          local grocer.
